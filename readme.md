This repository will include essential destiny 2 macros, feel free to change them to your liking.
I will have more macros soon.
All macros are written in AutoHotKeyScript, make sure to download the AutoHotKey software. It's opensource and free: https://autohotkey.com

I am in no way responsible if you get banned using these, use it at your own risk. However, I think Bungie is leniant and doesn't usually ban you for macros.

# List of current macros:
- Double Slug (To use, first place 2 anarchy shots, then switch to your ENERGY weapon. It will automatically ADS. Keybind: Ctrl+4)
- Quad Swapping (To use, be ready with your Xenophage. It will automatically ADS. Keybind: Ctrl+5)
- more soon...
