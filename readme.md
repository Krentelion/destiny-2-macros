This repository will include essential destiny 2 macros, feel free to change them to your liking.
I will have more macros soon.
All macros are written in AutoHotKeyScript, make sure to download the AutoHotKey software. It's opensource and free: https://autohotkey.com

I am in no way responsible if you get banned using these, use it at your own risk. However, I think Bungie is leniant and doesn't usually ban you for macros.

# Latest Update:
## 2021-08-20: 
- Added Hunter Skating macro.

# List of current macros:
- Double Slug (To use, first place 2 anarchy shots, then switch to your ENERGY weapon. It will automatically ADS. Requires 2 shotgun dexterity. Keybind: Ctrl+4)
- Quad Swapping (To use, be ready with your Xenophage. It will automatically ADS. Requires 1 machine gun and 1 shotgun dexterity. Keybind: Ctrl+5)
- Anti-AFK (To use, be ready with any weapon, preferably a weapon with lots of ammo. Note: Uneven terrain may cause slight issues with ads coordinates. Keybind: Alt+4)
- Thrallway AFK (To use, you need to be a warlock and have Trinity Ghoul equipped w/ catalyst. Melee resist is recommended, as well as double bow scavenger and finder. This can work with both thrallways, either the 1st or 2nd. To start, go to your usual spot you use to farm. You have two options: use devour, or sanguine alchemy, or both. If using devour, make sure to proc devour before macro usage. If using sanguine alchemy, make sure to place rift down before macro usage. Make sure to have lightning rod active before macro usage. As always kill switch is 0. Keybind: Numpad 0)
- Hunter Skate (To use, you must be on a hunter, duh, and use stasis subclass. Make sure to have the shatterdive aspect equipped as well. For this to work, you will also have to equip the Worldline Zero heavy exotic sword. Stomp-EE5 exotic boots are recommended to ensure maximum skating efficiency. If you don't know how to skate, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRmVcdsSwOA. To use this macro, before performing your heavy attack, instead press the macro button. This may not work with some terrains, so you may have to be more closer to the edge of the elevated terrain or less, it will depend. Press (1 or multiple times, depending on jump choice) space to jump even further, this has not been built in to the macro to not create any unnecessary keystrokes that the user may not want. Keybind: Numpad 1)
- more soon...
