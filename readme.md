This repository will include essential destiny 2 macros, feel free to change them to your liking.
I will have more macros soon.
All macros are written in AutoHotKeyScript, make sure to download the AutoHotKey software. It's opensource and free: https://autohotkey.com

I am in no way responsible if you get banned using these, use it at your own risk. However, I think Bungie is leniant and doesn't usually ban you for macros.

# Latest Update:
## 2021-08-16: 
- Added killswitch feature to all macros! All you have to do is press 0, and your macro will instantly stop. It won't close the file, so you can press the keybind again to initiate the macro. 
- Anti-AFK macro added. 
- AFK Thrallway macro added.

# List of current macros:
- Double Slug (To use, first place 2 anarchy shots, then switch to your ENERGY weapon. It will automatically ADS. Requires 2 shotgun dexterity. Keybind: Ctrl+4)
- Quad Swapping (To use, be ready with your Xenophage. It will automatically ADS. Requires 1 machine gun and 1 shotgun dexterity. Keybind: Ctrl+5)
- Anti-AFK (To use, be ready with any weapon, preferably a weapon with lots of ammo. Note: Uneven terrain may cause slight issues with ads coordinates. Keybind: Alt+4)
- Thrallway AFK (To use, you need to be a warlock and have Trinity Ghoul equipped w/ catalyst. Melee resist is recommended, as well as double bow scavenger and finder. This can work with both thrallways, either the 1st or 2nd. To start, go to your usual spot you use to farm. You have two options: use devour, or sanguine alchemy, or both. If using devour, make sure to proc devour before macro usage. If using sanguine alchemy, make sure to place rift down before macro usage. Make sure to have lightning rod active before macro usage. As always kill switch is 0. Keybind: Numpad 0)
- more soon...
